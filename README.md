# Astrology App

This is a simple astrology within a Python terminal. This app is capable of generating and interpretating your birth chart (all is required is your date of birth, time of birth and location of your birth), give your  daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly horoscope. 

Whether you're a believer in astrology or not, it's still a fun way to find out more about yourself.
